This project is about a chatbot application with **dart** Language using **flutter** through **Android-Studio** .. we need to get 4 flutter dependencies 
* Speech to text 
* Text to Speach 
* IBM Watson Assistant Chatbot
* Animation

First, the IBM Watson chatbot is a custom chatbot for the tournament of SmartMethod's robot.. you can find a related projects of the robots in my repositories..
 

> There are three files as dart extensions in the lib folder which are animation, Chatbot, and main.
1- animation: This file determine the duration of animation by adding a list of answers from the chatbot and a list of duration for every answer. Then, it returns the duration as an integer.
2- Chatbot: This file is containing the function to get the answer from the chatbot as text.
3- main: This file it is containing the run application.
Also, there is a file in the asset folder that contains face_robot_v1.riv as a Rive extension to do the animation.
